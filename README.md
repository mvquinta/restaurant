# restaurant
V01 - Project Restaurant for The Odin Project.

[Live Demo](https://mvquinta.github.io/restaurant/)

Objectives:
1) Create page trough DOM
2) Use Webpack
3) Create tabbed browsing (I applyed this in Food Menu Section)

All main objectives were done.
I also added some more css styles and implemented some responsive (not fully tested)

NOTE: NOT MOBILE READY!

///////////////

This was a project that I re-started one time since first version was more like a test field for implementing webpack.
Also gave this project a little more time to do it since I wanted to review some CSS foundations.
